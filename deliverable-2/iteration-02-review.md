## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

 - Decided to design the application initially in Figma where the members of the frontend team had a meeting and went over the slides provided by the partner regarding the mock of the application. We came up with an initial outline and the document was shown to the partner before coding it up in order to ensure that we were on the right track. Discussions regarding improving the design were held and the figma was shared with the backend team. Through this decision, keeping track of the app components and potential changes got easier.

- Decided to have at least one meeting per week with the partner to display our progress and discuss any questions that we came up with while coding. In the first meeting after td1, the backend team designed one single login page and showed to the partner to get feedback for the rest of the app design. 
- Decided to have in person team meetings rather than online since it was more interactive and efficient. We scheduled one meeting per week to go over the progress we made and resolve problems. We used Slack for online communication in case a member later came up with a question that wasn't discussed during the meeting.


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Although we decided the roles of each member, we didn't use Trello or any similar applications to formally assign roles, keep track of to-dos, tasks that were in progress, and the tasks that were completed. Thus, coordination between members of frontend and backend got a bit unclear.
- After assigning roles to frontend and backend team during the first meeting, we decided to make a fair amount of progress weekly. However, due to heavy workload of school, we fell behind in some of the tasks and had to work more towards the end.

#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
-  We plan to have more in person meetings with the respective teams as well such as front end and back end over the next few weeks in order to collaborate on the tasks to be completed to finish the project more efficiently.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
The demo to our project partner, Dr. Tatiana Kalashnikova, went successfully. 
We demonstrated the progress we made on the mobile application and she was very pleased with the progress.

To prepare for the demo, we listed all the features that we wanted to show.
Then, we created a series of steps that would show each feature in a fashion that would resemble a normal user of the app.
We showed the following features:
1. Login and Sign Up page
1. Initial survey for a pregnant woman
1. Weekly Dashboard
1. Fetal Development Page
1. Weight Gain and BP Page

The features are discussed in detail on the README.md.
Our team and the partner both agreed that the main features were being focused on for the demo and accepted the features.

The partner made the following requested changes:
1. For the Fetal Development page, add a toggle for the unit system conversion instead of showing both metric and imperial units
2. For the Weight Gain and BP Page, make the page focus on Weight Gain only

We also discussed future work surrounding the Survey Page, where the user will answer a survey each week and articles will be recommended, and the Medical Content Page, where more in-depth medical content will be displayed.

We learned that 
 * We learned the design requirements of our partner and also made a roadmap of features we will cover for our final MVP.
 * We also noted down all changes the partner recommended and plan on making them before TD3.
