# HEALTHY MOM AND CHILD+

> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 
## Description 
 * A unique health application that will help educate, monitor, and detect health issues with both women that are planning to conceive, pregnant, or have      given birth in the last three months (perinatal women), and their children up to the age of 12 years old.
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Significant changes and challenges occur in the life of a woman undergoing conception, pregnancy, or the baby nursing process and questions will arise due to this. Women in this category will search for answers to these questions. One of their greatest resources are family physicians and specialists. But access to these medical professionals can be limited in rural and remote areas of living. The lack of in-person consultations can directly affect the health of pregnant women and children. As alternatives, such as the Internet and existing mobile applications, can contain information that is not sufficient, nor detailed.
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?

## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access
 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application
 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully

 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).

 ## Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and how
 * Don't forget to **briefly explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 ## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice?
